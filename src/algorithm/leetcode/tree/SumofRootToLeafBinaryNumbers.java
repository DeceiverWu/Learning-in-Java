/**
 * Given a binary tree, each node has value 0 or 1.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13.
 * <p>
 * For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.
 * <p>
 * Return the sum of these numbers.
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
 * Output: 22
 * Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 1000.
 * node.val is 0 or 1.
 * The answer will not exceed 2^31 - 1.
